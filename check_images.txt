    AlexNET:	borzoi, russian wolfhound
    VGG:		eskimo dog, husky

2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
  Yes.

3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: 
  Yes, all 3 architectures correctly classified both images to not be dogs.

4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:
  I would pick ResNET.
  Purely based on my answers for questions 1-3 above, ResNET & VGG did an equally (though subjectively) better job at classifying the dog photos uploaded. The breed of the uploaded dog is American Akita, which is visually closer-looking to huskies than borzois, in terms of the bodybuild.
  All 3 architectures correctly identified the red panda as a red panda.
  Upon some closer examination at the printed reports, AlexNET fell even shorter when it classified the jasmine flowers as cabbage butterflies, turning plants into animals. ResNET did the best at classifying the 4 uploaded images overall, as (after a quick googling) bell pepper flowers (ResNET classification) actually look more similar to jasmine flowers than daisy (VGG classification), taking only 4s to complete, half of the time requires for VGG to complete.
